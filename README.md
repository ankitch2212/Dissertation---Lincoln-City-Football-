Background:-
Professional Football has been developing and growing at a tremendous rate over the years in the using more and more data to conduct analysis. Many companies tie up with teams in providing in-depth analysis on Players, Training, Match, Performance, etc. Not only IT companies but clubs also started their own data analysis team to get results faster and more precisely and also reduce the costs. However, until now most of these predictions have been based on metrics such as form, team strength and pass completion.

Aims:-
This dissertation will primary aim is to see if it is possible to predict injury occurrence purely from physical variables such as distance run and player Load, during a match or Training Season.

Methods:-
With data provided by Lincoln City FC, the analysis was conducted using regression, and three classification techniques (Decision Tree, Random Forest and K Nearest Neighbours) to try and predict injury occurrence as well as look to see if any relationships between injury and training variables. Acute and Chronic Workload Ratio is used in Injury Prediction.

Results:-
Regression and Classification model results were able to predict at a rate of 98% of accuracy which is due to fact that injury data is negligible in comparison to Training Data. While this is higher than other comparable studies mentioned in the literature review it is still high considering it was only using physical data. It did not look at internal load physiological questionnaire data, which can help with prediction significantly.

Conclusion
It is concluded that it is possible to make predictions based on physical data at a good rate considering the restrictions. However, there were several recommendations for future studies to make the predictions improve. These recommendations include looking into individual player positions, Physiological variables and that may affect their Injury Occurrence.
